### Hello thereðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex! I'm a test automation nerd, quality evangelist, and jack of most trades.
Orignally from California, I've lived in Denmark for most of my life; but now I live in Venezuela with my wife and son.
I learned to code so I could automate the boring parts of manual testing, and just kept going.
